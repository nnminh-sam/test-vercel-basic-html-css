            The moment I'm writing this is very close to the time you have to go
            back to Australia right. Just about 10 days. I'm so happy for our
            last three months. So much tears but also much more smile. I'm
            grateful for all of ours up and down. I miss our trips so much that
            sometime I cried about them...
